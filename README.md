# Kotlin Playground

## About
This is a small playground project for Kotlin, Java 8 and Maven.
This is where I put small samples I work as I learn Kotlin and work out how it integrates with Java and Maven.

## Commands
* `mvn site`: generate docs
  * Kotlin code documentation is created under target/dokka

## Maven setup
The maven configuration is based on:
* official Kotlin maven doc: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-maven.html
* Dokka for documentation: https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka
  * based on example here: https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-examples/blob/master/maven/dokka-maven-example/pom.xml
