# Kotlin Playground

## About
This is a small playground project for Kotlin, Java 8 and Maven.
This is where I put small samples I work as I learn Kotlin and work out how it integrates with Java and Maven.

## Maven setup
The maven configuration is based on:
* https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-maven.html
